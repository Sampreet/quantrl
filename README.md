# QuantRL: Quantum Control using Reinforcement Learning

![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.6-red?style=for-the-badge)

> A library of modules to interface deterministic and stochastic quantum models for reinforcement learning.

### Key Features!

* Quickly interface environments for Reinforcement Learning using Stable-Baselines3.
* Run multiple environments in parallel using vectorized inheritable classes.
* Support for deterministic and stochastic linear environments.
* Live visualization and learning curves.

### What's New in v0.0.6

* Initialize your environment with any of the different backends: NumPy, PyTorch and JAX.
* Solve IVPs for the popular libraries `TorchDiffEq` and `Diffrax`.
